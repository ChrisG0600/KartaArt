// Note 
//  Basically the artworks came from the defined method and relationship
//  It came from the Seller model since it is defined there.
//  Laravel provide a name when used the withCount()
// Naming of the laravel would be "methodDefinesinyourModel_count()"
//  
//  Example of the relationship in Seller model(Since I use Seller Model here on this method):
//  public function artworks() {
//      return $this->hasMany(Artwork::class, 'artist_name');
//  }
//
//  If the relationship method name changes, update withCount accordingly.
//  Basically if the artworks() has renamed, the withCount(['artworks']) shoule be change accordingly 
//  public function renamed() {
//      return $this->hasMany(Artwork::class, 'artist_name');
//  }
//  then apply it to: withCount(['renamed' => then the rest of the code])
